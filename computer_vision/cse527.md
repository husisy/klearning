## introduction to computer visioin

1. filters: smoothing, sharpening, increase contrast, de-noising, sampling, compressing, finding edges, blending
2. point operation
   * blending images
   * white balance
   * Gamma correction
   * histogram equalization
3. local operation: linear shift invariant, correlation, convolution
   * box filter, moving average (linear)
   * Gaussian Filter (linear)
   * sharpening (linear)
   * Sobel kernel (linear)
   * median filter (nonlinear)
   * Fourier transform (linear): **the FT of a convolution is the pointwise product of FTs**
   * low / high pass filters (nonlinear)
   * hybrid image
4. Laplacian pyramid blending
