## DeepLearningAI/ChatGPT

[link](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng)

1. two types of large language models (LLM)
   * base LLM: predict next word, based on text training data
   * instruction tuned LLM: fine-tune on instructions and good attempts at following instructions. reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)
2. principle
   * write clear and specific instructions. "clear" is NOT "short"
   * give the model time to think
3. tactic (principle 1)
   * use delimiter to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
     * e.g.: triple quotes `"""`, triple backticks (escaped in MarkDown), triple dashes `---`, angle brackets `<>`, xml tags `<tag></tag>`
     * avoiding prompt injections
   * ask for structured output: html, json
   * check whether conditions are satisfied: check assumptions required to do the task
   * few-shot prompting: give successful examples of completing tasks, then ask model to perform the task
4. tactic (principle 2)
   * specify the steps to complete a task
   * instruct the mode lto work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
5. (model limitations) hallucination: make statements that sound plausible but are not true
   * reducing hallucinations: first find relevant information then asswer the question based on the relevant information
6. iterative prompt development
   * idea
   * implementation (code/data/prompt)
   * experimental result
   * error analysis
7. prompt guidelines
   * be clear and specific
   * analyze why result does not give desired output
   * refine the idea and the prompt
   * repeat
8. iterative process
   * try something
   * analyze where the result does not give what you want
   * clarify instructions, give more time to think
   * refine prompts with a batch of examples
9. summarize
   * summarize with a word / sentence / character limit
   * summarize with a focus on xxx
   * try 'extract' instead of 'summarize'
   * summarize multiple product reviews
10. inferring
    * sentiment: positive, negative
    * identify types of emotions
    * identify anger
    * extract infromation
    * inferring topics
    * determining certain topics
11. transforming
    * translation
    * universal translator
    * tone transformation
    * format conversion
    * spellcheck/grammar check
12. expanding
    * `sign the email as "AI customer agent"`
13. `temperature`
    * `temperature=0`: for tasks that require reliability, predictability
    * larger `temperature`: for tasks that require variety
14. chatbot

   * advanced data analysis, code interpreter
   * ADA: advanced data analysis
3. prompt
   * Ex1: extract this document to plain text and then read the document
   * Ex2: re-read the text
   * Ex3: continue/proceed
4. prompt example: asking questions in a small document
   * 00: extract this document to plain text and then read the document and tell me all the pieces of information that it is requesting
   * 01: reread the text and break down the questions into the smallest level of detail. Provide the identifier for each question in the document or `[question-name]` if none exists
   * 02: continue (proceed)
5. prompt example: working with structure data
   * 00: read and explain the structure of the data in this document
   * 01: create a atable showing graduate and undergraduate enrollment by year with separate rows for each
   * 02: visualize each of these as separate series
   * 03: flip the chart so it increases in time as it moves to the right
   * 04: create a table that shows the ratio of graduate to undergraduate students over time as a decimal (graduate / undergraduate) and create a table displaying the resutls
   * 05: what other data is in the original dataset that correlates with this growth in the graduate population relative to the undergraduate population
   * 06: what about grants and contracts
6. prompt example: wroking with media
   * 00: extract 10 frames from this video evenly spaced spart
   * 01: display the images
   * 02: resize each image (maintain the aspect ratio) to 300px wide
   * 03: convert all of the images to gray scale and increase the contrast `30%`
   * 04: combine the images into an animated gif that flips to the next image at one second interval
   * 05: turn the individual images into a powerpoint presentation with one image per slide
   * 06: catalog all of the images in a CSV file with the name of the image, the name of the movie file that the image was extracted from, the time in the movie that it was extracted from, and the operations applied to it
7. prompt example: zip files for automation
   * 00Ôºö please make these images much more stylized by dramatically increasing the contrast and saturation
   * 01: zip up the files so that i can download them
   * 02: I need your help organizing the files in the uploaded zip. I want you to help figure out what is in them by opening and reading each one to create a summary. I want you to propose a folder structure that would better organize the files. I wnat you to propose better names for each file using just a-z and 0-9 (keep extensions). When you have all this done, show me your proposed folder structure and names
   * 03: can you try an alternatate method to figure out what is in the other category? try other ways fo getting text from the PDFs, Look at the file names. Keep trying and do your best
   * 04: this looks good. create a zip file with the files in this structure so that i can download it
8. prompt example: turning conversations into software utilities
   * **WARNING**: proceed only when you can understand code or you have some programming friends
   * 00: turn this process into a python program that i can download and run on my computer and provide the paths to the documents as command-line arguments. Zip up the program for me to download
9. working with small documents
   * structured or unstructured
   * size of unstructured documents: almost the size of a single message
10. getting information into the conversation
    * if you can see the information that it's going to build off of in the conversation, you are much more likely to be successful
    * reading and re-reading the text
    * build search index
    * 00: using your index, read the policies related to staying in an AirBnB and tell me if i can get reimbursed for this if the cost is less than the average hotel in the same city

4. cut tedious tasks through automation, freeing time for creative thought and problem-solving
   * 00: this is the list of people that registered for my workshop on prompt engineering and chatgpt. describe the data in this file
   * 01: please create a bar chart showing total registrations by department
   * 02: it looks like there is a lot of overlap between departments, alternate spellings, etc. Can you list all the departments and then do some intelligent grouping of them (e.g. "Owen" and "Owen XYZ", "dmbi" and "DMBI" and "Bioinformatics") so that alternate names or variations of names end up in the same group? show me the list after grouping
   * 03: look again at your grouping. critique your work. come up with a plan to fix any issues you see and then execute that plan
   * 04: the only last issues i see are "VUIT" vs "VU IT" and "OVPRI" vs. "Vanderbilt OVPRI", can you spot any other issues like this? do your work without python
   * 05: manually create a mapping of all the original departments in the registration to one of these sanitized departments
   * 06: create a CSV file that has this mapping. you should have a column for "original department" and "final department"

   * 03: please analyze the attached receipt and let me know if it complies
6. inspire better problem solving and creativity
   * 00: read and summarize the key points on each slide
   * 01: proceed
   * 02: act as a skeptic of everything i say in this presentation. find flaws in my assumption assertions, and other key points and then generate 10 hard questions for me

   * 05: figure out a way to draw a diagram that can be generated, even if it is more of a textual, directed graph, etc.
   * 06: the slides are for a workshop i am hosting for faculty. i don't want to spend any money, but i need to have a mechanism for managing registrations and sending out email notifications with the zoom link for the workshop. give me three different approachs for this process and reference specific tools (e.g., google forms) that i could use and the workflow between them
   * 07: these are the people that registered for my workshop. don't list any names of people, just look at their departments and ways they are using generative AI, and then give me some ideas for topics, questions, or other things they will care about related to my slides.
   * 08: i am going to create customized post-workshop emails for every attendee. I wnat you to create a list of interesting ChatGPT prompts and ways of combining LLMs with each discipline or department. each department needs at least one every interesting and creative prompt targeting the departments' discipline and one idea of how to apply LLM in the discipline. List all departments and the prompts / ideas beneath them
   * 09: turn these into a CSV that has columns for department, email, addresses, prompts / ideas for department so that i can easily do a mail merge that creates a custom email with these interesting ideas for each participant based on their department
   * 10: now, i need you to generate three exciting post-workshop email templates that can include these ideas. also, try to summarize what we explored in the workshop
   * 11: come up with four interesting interdisciplinary collaborations that could be formed amongst the departments that involve LLMs, use your list of departments, ideas and the current usege of LLMs listed in the registrations to inspire you
