set theory

1. complement $A^c=X\setminus A$
2. equivalence relation $\sim$: reflective, transitive, symmetric
   * $[x]$
   * quotient set $X/\sim$
3. countibility, set $X$
   * at most countably infinite: have injective map $f:X\to\mathbb{N}$
   * countably infinite: have bijective map $f:X\to \mathbb{N}$
   * personal-convention
     * do NOT use "countable"

basic concept

1. topological space $(X,T)$: $X$ is a set, $T$ is a collection of subsets of $X$
   * $X\in T$, $\emptyset\in T$
   * $T$ is closed under finite intersection
   * $T$ is closed under arbitrary unions
   * nomenclature: $T$ is the topology on $X$. $X$ is a topological space with topology $T$
   * equivalent definition on closed set: $X$ and $\emptyset$ are closed, $T$ is closed under finite union, $T$ is closed under arbitrary intersection
2. neighborhood of $y\in X$ is a subset $V\subseteq X$ that contains an open set $U$ such that $p\in U\subseteq V\subseteq X$
3. closed set $A\subseteq X$: $X\setminus A$ is open
   * example
     * $[a,b]$ in $\mathbb{R}$
     * closed unit ball in metric space
     * any subset in discrete space
4. subset $A\subseteq X$
   * open
   * closed
   * open and closed (e.g. $\emptyset$ and $X$)
   * neither open nor closed
5. point $p\in X$, subset $A\subseteq X$, topological space $(X,T)$
   * closure: $\mathrm{cl}(A)=\cap\{ B: A\subseteq B, B^c\in T \}$
   * interior: $\mathrm{int}(A)=\cup\{ B\in T: B\subseteq A \}$
   * exterior: $\mathrm{ext}(A)=X\setminus \mathrm{cl}(A)$
   * boundary: $\partial A=X\setminus(\mathrm{int}(A)\cup\mathrm{ext}(A))$
     * boundary contains isolated points
     * boundary is closed
   * derived set $A'$: set of all limit points in $A$
     * derived set is closed
   * $p\in\mathrm{int}(A)$: exists $U\in T$ such that $p\in U\subseteq A$
   * $p\in\partial A$: for all open set $p\in U\in T$, $U\cap A\ne \emptyset$ contains points in $A$ and points in $X\setminus A$
   * $p$ is a limit point of $A$: for all open set $p\in U\in T$, $(U\setminus\{p\})\cap A\ne \emptyset$
     * example: limit point of $A=(0,1)$ in $\mathbb{R}$: $[0,1]$
     * example: limit point of $A=\{\frac{1}{n}:n\in\mathbb{Z}_+\}$ in $\mathbb{R}$: $\{0\}$
   * $p$ is a isolated point of $A$ if: exists open set $p\in U\in T$ such that $U\cap A=\{p\}$
     * isolated point of $A=\{\frac{1}{n}:n\in\mathbb{Z}_+\}$ in $\mathbb{R}$: $A$
   * $A$ is dense: $\mathrm{cl}(A)=X$
     * iff every point of $X$ is a limit point of $A$
     * iff every nonempty open set in $X$ intersects $A$ (contains a point of $A$)
     * example: rational number $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$
6. space $(X,T)$, sequence of points $(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$, $x_i\in X$
   * converge to the limit, $(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\to x$ for $x\in X$ if: for all open set $x\in U\in T$, there is $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $x_i\in U$ for all $i\geq N$
7. continuous map: space $(X_1,T_1)$, space $(X_2,T_2)$, function $f:X_1\to X_2$
   * $f$ is continuous: for every open set $U_2\in T_2$, its pre-image $f^{-1}(U_2)\in T_1$
     * iff the pre-image of every closed set is closed
     * iff every point of $x\in X_1$ has a open set $x\in U_1$ (exists $U_1$) such that $f(x)\in f(U_1)\in T_2$
     * example: constant map, identity map, domain restriction $f|_U$, composition $f\circ g$
8. homeomorphism $X\cong Y$
   * def: a continuous map $f:X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism if there is a continuous map $g:Y\to X$ such that $g\circ f=\mathrm{id}_X$ and $f\circ g=\mathrm{id}_Y$
   * counter-example, bijective, but both $f$ and $g$ non-continuous: $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, $f(x)=x$ is $x$ is rational, $f(x)=x+1$ if $x$ is irrational
   * counter-example, continuous $f$ has inverse, but $g$ non-continuous
     * [stackexchange-link](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/68811)
     * $[0,1]\cup(2,3]\to [0,2]$
     * every bijective map $X\to K$ with $X$ non-compact and $K$ compact cannot have a continuous inverse
   * homeomorphism is equivalence relation
   * example
     * any two open balls in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are homeomorphic: translation, dilation (size is not a topological property)
     * the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n$ is homoemorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ $f(x): x\mapsto \frac{x}{1-\lVert x\rVert}$, inverse $g: y\mapsto \frac{y}{1+\lVert y \rVert}$ (boundedness is not a topo property)
     * the cube $C=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:\lVert x\rVert_\infty=1\}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ (corners are not a topo property)

1. subspace topology: given topological space $X$ and a subset $S\subset X$, we say $U$ is open in $S$ iff $U=S\cap V$ for some open set $V\in X$
   * example: $X=\mathbb{R}, S=[0,1)$, then $U=[0,\frac{1}{2})$ is open in $S$
2. open map
   * def: a continuous map $f:X\to Y$ is an open map if for every open set $U\in X$, $f(U)$ is open in $Y$
   * counter-example, continuous but not open map: $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, $f(x)=0$
3. closed map
   * def: a continuous map $f:X\to Y$ is a closed map if for every closed set $A\in X$, $f(A)$ is closed in $Y$
   * counter-example, contiuous but not closed map: $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, $f(x)=x^2$ (neither open nor closed)
4. suppose $f:X\to Y$ is a continuous bijective map, then the following is equivalent
   * $f$ is a homeomorphism
   * $f$ is open
   * $f$ is closed
5. local homeomorphism
   * def: a map $f:X\to Y$ is a local homeomorphism if each point $x\in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $f(U)$ is open in $Y$ and $f|_U:U\to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism
   * counter example, not equivalence relation: $\mathbb{S}^2$ is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$, there is no local homeomorphism from $\mathbb{S}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ [wiki-link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_homeomorphism)
   * counter example, local homeomorphism vs homeomorphism: $f:\mathbb{S}^1\to\mathbb{S}^1$, $f(z)=z^3$
   * proposition: a bijective local homeomorphism is a homeomorphism
6. Hausdorff space (counter example) $Z=\{1,2,3\}, T=\{\emptyset,\{1\},\{1,2\},\{1,2,3\}\}$
   * $\{1\}$ is not closed
   * constant sequence $(2,2,\cdots)$ has $2$ and $3$ as limit
7. Hausdorff space
   * def: a topological space $X$ is Hausdorff if for every pair of distinct points $x,y\in X$, there are disjoint open sets $U,V\in X$ such that $x\in U$ and $y\in V$ (disjoint neighborhoods)
   * example
     * all metric space (spaces that aren't Hausdorff aren't going to be metrizable)
     * discrete space
   * prop: any finite subset of a hausdorff space is closed
   * prop: in Hausdorff spaces, convergent sequences have unique limits
   * prop: suppose $X$ is Hausdorff and $A\subseteq X$. If $p\in X$ is a limit point of $A$, then every neighborhood of $p$ contains infinitely many points of $A$
     * comment: finite subset cannot have limit point, so $A$ must be infinite
8. basis $\mathcal{B}$: a collection of subsets of a topological space $X$
   * def: every $B\in\mathcal{B}$ is open, every open subset of $X$ is the union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$
   * example
     * open balls form a basis for metric space $(\mathcal{M},d)$: $\mathcal{B}=\{B(x,r):x\in\mathcal{M},r>0\}$ (metric space is defined in this way)
     * the collection of all singletons is a basis for the discrete topology on any set
   * (basis criterion) subset $U\subseteq X$ is open iff for each $p\in U$, there is $B\in\mathcal{B}$ with $p\in B \subseteq U$
   * (continuity criterion) a map $f:X\to Y$ is continuous iff $f^{-1}(B)$ is open for each $B\in\mathcal{B}$ (basis for $Y$)
9. unique topology: let $X$ be a set and $\mathcal{B}$ a collection of subsets of $X$. Then $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a unique topology on $X$ iff
   * $\cup_{B\in\mathcal{B}}B=X$
   * for each $B_1,B_2\in\mathcal{B}$ and each $p\in B_1\cap B_2$, there is $B_3\in\mathcal{B}$ with $p\in B_3\subseteq B_1\cap B_2$

1. second countable: a topological space is called second countable if it has a countable basis for its topology
   * every Euclidean space is second countable
     * $\mathcal{B}=\{B(x,r):x\in\mathcal{M},r>0\}$ is uncountable
     * $\mathcal{B}=\{B(x,r):x\in\mathbb{Q}^n, r\in\mathbb{Q}_{>0}\}$ is countable
   * necessary for topological manifold
2. neighborhood basis: a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of neighborhoods of $p\in X$ is called a neighborhood basis for $p$ if every neighborhood of $p$ contains some element of $\mathcal{B}$
3. first countable: a topological space is called first countable if it has a countable neighborhood basis for each of its points
   * every second countable space is first countable
   * counter-example, not first countable: cofinite topology on an infinite set [wiki-link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofiniteness#Cofinite_topology)
   * counter-example, first countable but not second countable: $\mathbb{R}$ in a discrete topology $d(x,y)=0$ if $x=y$, $d(x,y)=1$ if $x\neq y$
   * useful in convergent sequence
   * prop: suppose $X$ is first countable, then
     * $p\in \mathrm{cl}(A)$ iff $p$ is a limit of a sequence in $A$
     * $p\in \mathrm{int}(A)$ iff every sequence in $X$ converges to $p$ is eventually in $A$

   * def: a space $\mathcal{M}$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$ if every point $p\in\mathcal{M}$ has a neighborhood $U$ that is homeomorphic to an open ball $\mathbb{B}^n\in\mathbb{R}^n$ (or any open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, or $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself)
   * def: a $n$-dimensional topological manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$
   * terminology
     * topological manifold $\mathcal{M}$
     * point $x\in \mathcal{M}$
     * coodinate domain $U_x$ (neighborhood)

     * coordinate chart $(u_x,\phi_x)$
     * atlas $\mathcal{A}=\{(u_x,\phi_x):x\in \mathcal{M}\}$

7. $n$-dimensional manifold with boundary
   * def: a second coutable Hausdorff space in which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{H}^n$
   * WARNING ambiguity in terminology: boundary of a manifold, boundary of a set in topological space
     * topological interior of a manifold doesn't necessary have to be its interior
   * theorem: no point of a manifold with boundary is both a boundary point and an interior point
8. inclusion map: $A\subseteq B$, $\iota:A\hookrightarrow B$
   * $f\circ \iota=f|_A$

6. locally (path) connected
   * def: a space $X$ is locally (path) connected if it admits a basis of (path) connected open subsets.
   * prop: any neighborhood of $p\in X$ contains a (path) connected open set of $p$

1. def open cover: an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ of a space $X$ is a collection of open subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$
2. def subcover: a subcover $U$ is a subcollection of elements of $U$ that still covers $X$
3. def compact: a space $X$ is compact if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover
   * in Euclidean space: compact, iff closed and bounded (Bolzanoâ€“Weierstrass theorem) [wiki-link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem)
   * a subset $A\subseteq X$ is compact if $A$ is compact in the subspace topology
   * example
     * every finite space is compact
     * every space with the trivial topology is compact
     * a subset of a discrete space is compact iff it is finite
   * a subset $A\subseteq X$ is compact iff every collection $\{U_\alpha\}_\alpha$ of open subsets of $X$ such that $A\subseteq \cup_\alpha U_\alpha$ has a finite subcover
     * let $X$ be a space (may not compact) and let $(x_i)_i$ be a sequence in $X$ converging to $y\in X$. then the subset $\{x_i:i\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}\}\cup \{y\}$ is compact
   * theorem: let $X$ and $Y$ be spaces, and $f:X\to Y$ continuous. If $X$ is compact, then $f(X)$ is compact
   * lemma: let $X$ be a Hausdorff space and $A,B\subseteq X$ disjoint compact subsets. then there are disjoint open subsets $U,V$ with $A\subset U$ and $B\subset V$
   * prop:
     * closed subsets of compact spaces are compact
