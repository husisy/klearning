## 1-0 the internet and IP introduction

1. concept
   * layering
   * encapsulation
   * packet switching
   * 4-layer model
   * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   * Internet Protocol (IP)

## 1-1 a day in the life of an application

1. byte stream model
   * bidirectional, reliable byte stream connection
2. World Wide Web (WWW)
   * HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   * document-centric
3. BitTorrent
   * Tracker, Client
   * pieces, swarms
4. Skype
   * Network Address Translator (NAT)
   * reverse connection
   * relay

## 1-2 the four layer internet model

1. 4-layer internet model
   * Link: deliever data over a single link between an end host and router, or between routers
   * Network: delivers datagrams end-to-end. must use IP
   * Transport: Guarantees correct, in-order delivery of data end-to-end, control congestion
   * Application: use application-specific semantics (e.g. http, bit-torrent)
2. Link
   * end-hosts, links and routers
   * Ethernet, WiFi, DSL, 3G cellular
   * Router
3. Network
   * Packet (datagrams): self-contained collection of data, a header (from, to)
   * Internet Protocol (IP): deliver datagrams to the other end; can get lost, can be delivered out of order, can be corrupted
4. Transport
   * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   * User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
   * Real Time data Protocol (RTP)
5. 7-layer Open System Interconnection (OSI) model

## 1-3 the ip service model

1. concept
   * transport segment: `data` + `header`
   * IP datagram: `transport segment (IP data)` + `IP header`
   * link frame: `IP datagram (Link Data)` + `link header`
2. IP service model
   * datagram: individually routed packets, hop-by-hop routing
   * unreliable: can be dropped
   * best effort: but only if necessary
   * connectionless: no per-flow state, mis-sequenced
3. reason
   * simple, dumb, minimal: faster, more steamlined and lower cost to build and maintain
   * the end-to-end principle: where possible, implement features in the end hosts
   * allow a variety of reliable (or unreliable) services to be built on top
   * work over any link layer: IP makes very few assumptions about the link layer below
4. IP service model
   * try to prevent packets looping forever: Time To Live (TTL)
   * will fragment packets if they are too long
   * use a header checksum to reduce chances of delivering datagram to wrong destination
   * allow for new versions of IP: IPv4 (32bit), IPv6 (128bit)
   * allow for new options to be added to header
5. IPv4 datagram
   * source IP address
   * destination IP address
   * Protocol ID: 6 (TCP), the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   * version: IPv4, IPv6
   * total packet length
   * Time To Live (TTL)
   * Packet ID, Flags, Fragment Offset
   * type of service
   * header length
   * OPTIONS
   * checksum

## 1-4 A day in the life of a packet

1. 3-way handshake
   * synchronize (SYN)
   * synchronize and acknowledge (SYN/ACK)
   * acknowledge (ACK)
2. forwarding table
3. tools
   * `wireshark`
   * `traceroute`

## 1-5 packet switching principle

1. packet: a self-contained unit of data that carries information necessary for it to reach its destination
2. flow: a collection of datagrams belonging to the same end-to-end communication
3. packet swtiching: indepedently for each arriving packet, pick its outgoing link. If the link is free, send it, else hold the packet for later
   * simple packet forwarding
   * efficient sharing of links
   * no per-flow state required
4. types of packet switch
   * router / gateway
   * ethernet switch
5. statistical multiplexing; data traffic is bursty, share link capacity

## 1-6 layering principle

1. layering
   * functional components
   * communicate sequentially with the layers above and below
   * provide a well-defined service to the layer above, using the service provided by layers below and its own private processing
2. reasons
   * modularity
   * well defined service
   * reuse
   * separation of concerns
   * continuous improvement
   * peer-to-peer comumunication

## 1-7 encapsulation principle

1. VPN
2. Transport Layer Security (TLS)

## 1-8a byte order

1. Endianness
   * little endian: least significant byte (LSB) is at lowest address
   * big endian: most significant byte (MSB)

## 2-5 error detection

1. cyclic redundancy code (CRC)
   * Ethernet
   * easy in hardware
   * protects against any 2bit error, any burst `<=c` bits long, any odd number of errors
2. message authentication code (MAC)
   * TLS
3. checksum
   * IP
   * fast and cheap, but weak

## 2--6a finite state machines
